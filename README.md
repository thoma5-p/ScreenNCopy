# ScreenNCopy

ScreenNCopy allows you to easily and accurately convert a screenshot into clipboard pasteable text.
The main purpose of this project was to counter writing text from a Teams call and therefore being much more efficient...

ScreenNCopy lets you take a screenshot of a specific location on your screen which is converted to gray scale to help improve the OCR (optical character recognition) clarity, OCR is used to "convert" the image to a string which is split up to words and then (if enabled) uses a basic auto-correct which just uses a large list of vocubalary which is then compared to the each individual string and updated accordingly to increase accuracy.
